CSS:
Refactoring the css to separate out global variables and styles into localized modules
Then @use (actually @import) those modules into their coorisponding component
Currently reading about the 7-1 sass pattern here: https://sass-guidelin.es/#the-7-1-pattern

JS Modules:
Also looking into how to create an es6 module to reuse whenever I need a checkered pattern or gradient made. (like in ColorSlider and Swatch)

Also trying to figure out how to make a git branch before I refactor all the css
